Well, what could be done at this point is creating some test data where

the next c program can delete trailing tabs and empty lines.				
Might even be a chance to a chance				




to think about how this test data could test edge case. 			
What could be difficult?




Multiple empty lines.
			
Lines containing only tabs, so it is not really empty at first, but definitly after trimming trailing tabs. :-)
				
				

Such stuff. And no empty line at the end, just to be annoying :-)
